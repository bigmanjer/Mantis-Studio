-  Debugging Streamlit issues (blank pages, state resets, key collisions)
-  Refactoring and code organization
-  Session state management patterns
-  Deployment and production readiness

**To use the agent:**
1. Open GitHub Copilot Chat
2. Type `@mantis-engineer` followed by your question
3. Example: `@mantis-engineer How do I fix session state resets?`

##  What This Document Covers

This README explains **what the app does, how it is structured, what every major button/section is supposed to do, and how the UI flows from a users point of view**.

---

## 1. HighLevel Purpose

Mantis Studio is meant to replace scattered tools (notes apps, docs, AI chats, spreadsheets) with **one guided creative workspace**:

* Centralized project management
* AIassisted outlining and drafting
* Structured worldbuilding (characters, locations, lore)
* Persistent memory and insights
* Clean export for manuscripts or planning docs

The app is **statedriven**, not pagedriven. All navigation feeds a single app shell (`app/main.py`).

---

---

## 7. Troubleshooting & Support

###  Experiencing Issues?

If you encounter problems like black screens, rendering issues, or errors:

1. **[ Complete Debugging Guide](docs/HANDBOOK.md)** - Comprehensive troubleshooting, debug mode, and visual guide
2. **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/bigmanjer/Mantis-Studio/issues)** - Report bugs or search for solutions

### Quick Debug Steps

1. Enable debug mode in sidebar: **Advanced > Enable Debug Mode**
2. Check terminal logs for error messages
3. Use the Debug Panel in sidebar to inspect app state
4. See the [debugging guide](docs/HANDBOOK.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions

### Known Issues & Planned Improvements

#### Current Limitations

* Some AI features are experimental
* View files in `app/views/` are thin wrappers; render logic still lives in `app/main.py` (see `app/README.md` for migration status)

#### Recommended Next Steps for Contributors

1. Add in-app tutorial/walkthrough mode
2. Create sample projects for users to explore
3. Add keyboard shortcuts reference
4. Improve error messages to be more helpful
5. Add video tutorials for key workflows

---

## 8. Versioning System

* **Current Version**: 91.6 (stored in `VERSION.txt`)
* **Version Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR` (e.g., 87.0, 87.1, 88.0)

### Versioning Rules

The version increments with each merge following these rules:

1. **Minor version** increments by 1 on each merged pull request to `main`
   - Example: 91.0  91.1  91.2
   - Rolls over at 10: 91.9  92.0

2. **Major bumps** are handled via the Version Bump workflow dispatch inputs

3. **Manual updates** to VERSION.txt are reflected immediately in the UI

### How It Works

* Version is read from `VERSION.txt` at startup
* Can be overridden with `MANTIS_APP_VERSION` environment variable
* Displayed in UI header for transparency
* The Version Bump GitHub Action bumps patch versions on merge
* Use `python scripts/bump_version.py` to increment the patch version locally

### Manual Version Bump

To bump the patch version for the next release:

```bash
python scripts/bump_version.py
```

For minor or major bumps, use the Version Bump workflow dispatch inputs.

## 14. End-to-End Codebase Audit (2026-02-08)

### 1) Critical bugs (must-fix)
- **Startup crash when config contains non-numeric preferences**
  - **Root cause:** `initialize_session_state()` casted numeric config values with `int()` directly, which raises `ValueError` if the JSON file stores an empty string or malformed value.
  - **Location:** `app/state.py` (lines 95118).
  - **Corrected implementation:** added a `_safe_int()` helper with fallback defaults to prevent session-state initialization crashes.
- **Project load fails with missing file path**
  - **Root cause:** `Project.load()` opened the file without handling `FileNotFoundError`, causing an unhandled exception if the saved path is deleted or moved.
  - **Location:** `app/main.py` (lines 816829) and `app/services/projects.py` (lines 487500).
  - **Corrected implementation:** wrap file open in `try/except FileNotFoundError`, log the error, and raise a clear `ValueError` for UI-friendly handling.

### 2) Structural improvements
- **Single source of truth for config/models**
  - **Issue:** `app/main.py` duplicates `AppConfig`, `Project`, and `AIEngine` logic that also exists in `app/config/settings.py` and `app/services/`.
  - **Risk:** divergent behavior and hard-to-maintain updates.
  - **Recommended refactor:** move all model/config logic to `app/services/` + `app/config/`, and import them from `app/main.py` to keep runtime behavior consistent.
- **Monolithic main.py rendering**
  - **Issue:** view logic still lives in `app/main.py`, while `app/views/` is thin.
  - **Recommendation:** progressively move per-page render functions into `app/views/` and keep `app/main.py` focused on orchestration only.
- **UX flow friction**
  - **Issue:** new users land on a dashboard with no guided next action for creating a first project and must discover AI configuration manually.
  - **Recommendation:** add a first-run wizard (project creation + API key onboarding) and contextual CTA buttons (e.g., Create first outline).

### 3) Performance optimizations
- **Avoid quadratic string concatenation in AI responses**
  - **Root cause:** `AIEngine.generate()` appended to a Python string in a loop, which becomes O(n) on large outputs.
  - **Location:** `app/services/ai.py` (lines 160164).
  - **Corrected implementation:** collect chunks into a list and `''.join()` (implemented).
- **Cache expensive requests**
  - Use `st.cache_data` for model-list probes and long-running entity scans so repeated reruns dont re-fetch data.
- **Batch state updates**
  - Consolidate repeated `st.session_state` writes in write-heavy flows (chapter editor, world bible review) to reduce reruns.

### 4) Modern feature additions
1. **Workflow automation pipelines**
   - **User value:** run outline  draft  revision  export as a single pipeline.
   - **Architecture fit:** add `app/services/pipelines.py` and persist steps in project metadata.
   - **Implementation:** define a pipeline schema, queue steps, and use background tasks to update the UI.
2. **Plugin / extension system**
   - **User value:** custom AI tools, templates, or integrations without core changes.
   - **Architecture fit:** load plugins from `plugins/` with a simple registry contract.
   - **Implementation:** dynamic import + capability manifest, with safe sandboxing for UI widgets.
3. **Context memory snapshots**
   - **User value:** store project memory at milestones and roll back to earlier narrative canon.
   - **Architecture fit:** extend project schema with versioned memory blocks.
   - **Implementation:** lightweight snapshot store + diff viewer.
4. **Batch exports + integrations**
   - **User value:** export entire project packs or sync with Notion/Google Docs.
   - **Architecture fit:** expand `app/services/export.py` with integration adapters.
   - **Implementation:** exporter registry and background processing.

### 5) Competitive comparison summary
- **Strengths:** local-first workflow, structured world bible, AI-assisted drafting, clear single-entry architecture.
- **Gaps vs modern AI writing suites (Sudowrite, NovelAI, Notion AI, Scrivener):**
  - Limited onboarding guidance and templates.
  - No collaboration or cloud sync.
  - Missing workflow automation and plugin ecosystem.
  - Lacks granular version history and rollback.
  - UI polish and quick actions lag behind modern SaaS editors.

### 6) Prioritized upgrade roadmap (short / mid / long term)
- **Short term (02 months):**
  - Finish view extraction from `app/main.py`.
  - Add first-run onboarding wizard and inline guidance.
  - Standardize error handling (user-safe toasts + logged errors).
- **Mid term (26 months):**
  - Introduce snapshot-based version history.
  - Add pipeline automation (outline  draft  export).
  - Begin plugin/extension system design.
- **Long term (612 months):**
  - Collaboration + cloud sync layer.
  - Marketplace-ready plugin ecosystem.
  - Deep integrations (Notion, Google Docs, Obsidian).
