# Trademark Path

If you want to use the MANTIS Studio name or logo beyond the permissions in Brand and IP Clarity:

1. **Prepare a request** describing the intended use (product name, distribution channels, geography, duration).
2. **Include samples** of the mark usage (mockups or links).
3. **Send your request** to brand@mantis-studio.example.
4. **Await approval** and follow any guidelines provided.

Trademark usage is evaluated on a case-by-case basis and may require a written agreement.
